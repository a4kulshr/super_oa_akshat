My name's Akshat Kulshreshtha and I have had experience with data-related solution creation for 2 years.

Here is the assessment, and I want to thank the Super team for giving me the opportunity to take this assessment.

I look forward to speaking about myself more in the interview.

### Project Context

This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and transforming a raw, semi-structured flight dataset into a clean, usable format.

-   **`process_flights.py`**: This is the main script that contains all the logic for data processing. It takes a hardcoded string of messy flight data, applies a series of cleaning and formatting rules, and prepares it for analysis.

-   **`Cleaned_Airline_Data.csv`**: This is the final output file generated by the Python script. It contains the transformed, clean data in a structured CSV format.
